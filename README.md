## Business needs
### We want from you to create a sample App with the following requirements:

● Main Screen containing a list of Repositories from GitHub with Name and Author, only
showing those that match the criteria "language:kotlin"

● Once the user clicks any item on the list, it should Navigate to a second screen to
display Details about the Repository selected.

We work in a fast-paced environment with a constantly evolving product. Consider these
requirements would probably change and/or extend in a real-world scenario, and exercise
professional judgment while designing a Minimum Viable Product that should be flexible.
